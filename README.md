## Summary

In 2014 when Russia first invaded Ukraine, it seemed much more unexpected than their most recent attempt, which started on the 24th of February 2022. However, if one examined Russian state media channels back then it was clear that Putin’s regime was preparing the Russian population for both the occupation of Crimea and for fighting so-called ‘facism’ in Eastern Ukraine.

This visualisation of the most frequently used words in one of the main Russian state media [websites](https://ria.ru/) uses Python to crawl the web page, extract titles of the articles, translate them using the Google translate Python package, and finally creates a plot with the font size representing relative frequency of the first fifty words used in the articles. 

In the last three days since I’ve created this script, almost no words related to war or invasion have appeared in the first fifty most frequently used words. Perhaps unsurprisingly, adjectives such as ‘liberated’ or ‘operations’ seem to have been used instead. The most common words relate to the reaction of the West in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

The next step will be to create visualisations of the words that are most commonly used together (e.g., ‘liberated Donetsk’). It can prove to be informative to monitor the Russian state media propaganda channels, as these have the potential to hint at Putin's intentions.
